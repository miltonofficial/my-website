A quick reference guide for testers diving into GraphQL APIs:

## âœ… Key Points

### 1. Single Endpoint  
GraphQL uses a **single endpoint** for all queries and mutationsâ€”simpler than RESTâ€™s multiple endpoints.

### 2. Works Only with POST  
GraphQL typically uses the **POST** method. The actual query or mutation is passed in the request body.

### 3. No Versioning Required  
Clients request exactly the data they need, removing the need for versioning. You can evolve APIs without breaking existing queries.

### 4. Always HTTP 200  
GraphQL always returns an HTTP **200 OK**, even when the response contains errors. Error messages are delivered via an `"errors"` field in the JSON.

### 5. Schema is Everything  
The **GraphQL schema** is the contractâ€”it defines the data, types, queries, and relationships. Tools rely on this for introspection and auto-completion.

### 6. Postman Has Built-in GraphQL Support  
Postman natively supports GraphQL, allowing schema import, autocomplete, query testing, and moreâ€”making it a powerful tool for testers.

## ðŸ§­ Summary

GraphQL changes the testing mindset from REST. You test against a **contract-driven, schema-first** architecture with a single dynamic endpoint. Understanding how it returns data and errors is key to building reliable automation and test strategies.
